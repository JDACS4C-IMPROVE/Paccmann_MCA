# Paccmann-MCA
Paccmann-MCA is a multimodal attention-based convolutional encoder based model for cancer drug response prediction

## Structure
This model uses SMILES strings as drug features and gene expression as cell-line features. The drug sensitivity data is obtained from the publicly available Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database. A subset of genes are selected using the STRING protein-protein interaction (PPI) network.
